# This program takes the employee class and dervies a manger class from it. The employee class takes the managers name, salary, hours worked in the week, and is also able to calculate the pay of the employee. The manager class adds a bonus for each manager as well as overrides the calc pay class to include the bonus. In the main file the main file creates a pointer to an array of the number of mangers inputted by the user. Then traverses to get information on each of the mangers. The program then goes on to calculate which manger has the highest pay and the average pay for all of the mangers then deletes each element of the array.
